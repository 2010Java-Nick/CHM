# Covid Human Matcher (CHM)

# Project Description
In Covid times… We cannot make connections like we used to. As it stands, limiting exposure to new people is key to staying healthy. But how would one fill that void? We propose a new application to assist users in meeting each other virtually to build new connections and scratch that social itch. This application would allow users to create profiles that will be used to match with other users based on interests they have. Users will pose a question to new matches that will need to be answered before the match is confirmed. Once this question is answered, both users will have the ability to chat. The options for chatting will be dependent on their users account type. They will have the ability to send various types of multimedia over messages depending on user type as well. We also wanted to give users more control over who they match with and who they maintain connections with. One button press should prevent any further contact with a given match.
